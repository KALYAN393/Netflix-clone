# Netflix-clone
Project Description
This is a front-end clone of the Netflix website made with HTML, CSS, javascript, and React.JS. It's not a clone, and it lacks some of the features found on the Netflix website. It's a clone of Netflix with my own design touches, demonstrating my javascript skills to create something complex like Netflix. The home page, sign-in page, sign-up page, browse page, and movie player are all included.
